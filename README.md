Files

 - `autogen_lems.xml` : autogenerated glomerular gap junction code + simulation
 - `GlomerularGapJunction.xml` : the file that needs to be written
 - `main.py` : python code that simulated a glomerular gap junction and generated `autogen_lems.xml`
 - `Sim.xml` : run simulation

Run a simulation of neurons connected with gap junctions (currently just the example)

```
pynml ./Sim.xml
```

Run glomerular gap junction model without connected neurons

```
pynml ./autogen_lems.xml
```

Goal: integrate the mechanisms of `autogen_lems.xml` in `GlomerularGapJunction.xml`.
